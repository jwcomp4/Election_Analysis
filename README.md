# Module 3 Challenge: Election Analysis

## Overview of the Election Audit

- This election audit helps to certify the results for an congressional election in Colorado. While Excel is capable of anlyzing tabular data such as this voting data, using Python will allow us to automate the process and use a refactored version of this code to audit and certify other elections. 

- In this challenge, I am developing a Python script that will print the following data to the terminal:
    - Total Votes
    - Amount of votes per county and the percentage of the vote each county represents
    - County with the largest voter turnout
    - How many votes each candidate received and their respective percentage of the vote
    - Name of the winning candidate, the amount of votes they received, and percentage of the vote

- The same data noted above will be printed and saved to a .txt file entitled "election_analysis.txt" in to the "Resources directory.

    - Denver County: 306,055 votes (82.8% of total votes)
    - Jefferson County: 24,801 votes (6.7% of total votes)

- Denver County had the largest voter turnout.

- Candidate vote data:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes (23.0% of the total votes).
    - Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes (73.8%% of the total votes).

- Diana DeGette won the election receiving 272,892 votes (73.8% of the total votes).

## Election Audit Summary

points to cover: brief description of the code's use of variables and how it makes the code flexible 
simply refactoring the code with appropriate variable names could make this code easier to read for mayoral or gubernatorial elections. 

Could also note that with some modification more script could be added to calculate the vote county and vote percentage for each candidate in each county.
